# Food Tracker App

This app can be used to track your eating habits. It's based on operating .xlsx files using openpyxl library. 
App also keeps track of actual date and separates particular months into different spreadsheets.

App runns in command line and allows following actions:
- add food to spreadsheet
- remove last food added
- insert n. of bowel movements per day
- show all food in actual month
- quit 

This app can be handy for healthy-eating freaks. After creating an executable file from it, I use the app daily.
